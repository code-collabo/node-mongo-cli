`node-mongo-cli` is a command-line interface tool useful to initialize, scaffold and make mongoDB development easier in nodejs environment. With the CLI, you can install any of the starter kit templates - [es6](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-starter-kit) and [cjs](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-starter-cjs). It not only helps install the starter-kit, but also allows you to add new model and controller files with content using simple commands.

The [cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli) is built to help provide better experience when using the starter-kit in MongoDB, MERN or MEAN projects.
